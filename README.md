## Description
### This is a simple RGB color guessing game that I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game displays an RGB triplet and colored squares, and the player is supposed to guess which of the squares corresponds to the provided RGB triplet. It has two difficulty settings, Easy and Hard, that determine the number of squares displayed. On Easy mode, the player has to choose between 3 different squares, while there are 6 different squares on Hard mode. If the player selects the correct square, they are given the opportunity to play again or change the mode. If the player selects an incorrect square, they can choose from the remaining squares until they choose the correct one.

### This project was based on a project from [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/#instructor-1)'s course, [The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). I have made multiple changes from the original project, but the main concepts and techniques are from Colt.
